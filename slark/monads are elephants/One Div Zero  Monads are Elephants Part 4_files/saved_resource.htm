<p>Marc, that's not a silly question at all but a deeply insightful one.  One aspect of Erlang's binary syntax is that they act a bit like limited special purpose parsers for bit patterns.  As it turns out monads are a nice way to build parsers.<br><br>Having said that, though, I'm not sure that parsers are the best way to duplicate Erlang's capabilities here.  First, bit patterns are underpowered as parsers.  They don't even have the power of regular expressions let alone full CFGs. But this is deliberate, the patterns they can match can very cheaply be matched in linear time and constant space (not counting the variables that you bind to).<br><br>On the other hand, they do have the capability of using a variable bound earlier in the  match as a parameter later in the match.  For example you can have one variable for length get bound to the first 8 bits and then used that length later to match a variable number of bytes.<br><br>So after all that my short answer is: maybe but maybe not.  I'd certainly recommend checking it out!</p>

<p>Marc, that's not a silly question at all but a deeply insightful one.  One aspect of Erlang's binary syntax is that they act a bit like limited special purpose parsers for bit patterns.  As it turns out monads are a nice way to build parsers.<br><br>Having said that, though, I'm not sure that parsers are the best way to duplicate Erlang's capabilities here.  First, bit patterns are underpowered as parsers.  They don't even have the power of regular expressions let alone full CFGs. But this is deliberate, the patterns they can match can very cheaply be matched in linear time and constant space (not counting the variables that you bind to).<br><br>On the other hand, they do have the capability of using a variable bound earlier in the  match as a parameter later in the match.  For example you can have one variable for length get bound to the first 8 bits and then used that length later to match a variable number of bytes.<br><br>So after all that my short answer is: maybe but maybe not.  I'd certainly recommend checking it out!</p>

<p>Hi James! I've greatly enjoyed the series so far.  It's been one of the best introductions to monad's that I've read.  Perhaps, though, you feel that "monad introductions" are just <i>so</i> 2007, and that it would be inappropriate to continue in 2008.  <br><br>IMHO, a monad introduction in '08 would be <i>so</i> retro.  I think you should go for it ;^).</p>

<p>&gt;I am happy that Scala does not force one &gt;style or the other, so I hope that the &gt;different styles can coexist quite nice,<br><br>I'm a neophyte to FP/scala/monads.  But as I understand the point of pure FP and side effects is that you cannot mix them.  If anything (say some IO) has side effects then the whole program is imperative.<br><br>One suggested value of a pure FP approach is that running in a multithreaded environment requires no locking.  <br><br>Another reference (which I cannot find) suggested that the IO monad provided a good model for stateless http protocols with cookies in the "world state".</p>

<p>&gt;I am happy that Scala does not force one &gt;style or the other, so I hope that the &gt;different styles can coexist quite nice,<br><br>I'm a neophyte to FP/scala/monads.  But as I understand the point of pure FP and side effects is that you cannot mix them.  If anything (say some IO) has side effects then the whole program is imperative.<br><br>One suggested value of a pure FP approach is that running in a multithreaded environment requires no locking.  <br><br>Another reference (which I cannot find) suggested that the IO monad provided a good model for stateless http protocols with cookies in the "world state".</p>

<p>Tank you so very much for these articles - easy-to-grasp explanations are such a great time saver :-)</p>
