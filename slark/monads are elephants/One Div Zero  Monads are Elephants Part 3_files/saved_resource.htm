<p>Good question.  You certainly could create some reusable tests that are parameterized with functions to be used in map or flatMap.  You might also need to parameterize the function to use for equality, since it might not coincide with the definition of ==.</p>

<p>In Scala, as with other statically typed functional languages, functions have types.  Both f and g must be functions of the right type for flatMap.  If you have an instance of a monad with type M[A] then g must be of type A -&gt; M[B].  In other words, it must take a value of type A as an argument and return a value of type M[B] as a return.  Similarly, f must be of type B -&gt; M[C].</p>

<p>First: thank you for putting together these articles. I'm still working my way through them, but they've been very helpful so far. </p>

<p>I think I'm misunderstanding something basic or that my process of reasoning about types is faulty, but I'm confused by the statement "flattening m is the same as flatMapping m&nbsp; with the identity function" and the reasoning leading up to it. How can flatMap be applied to the identity function? Doesn't this function lack the correct type signature for flatMap?</p>

<p>First: thank you for putting together these articles. I'm still working my way through them, but they've been very helpful so far. <br><br>I think I'm misunderstanding something basic or that my process of reasoning about types is faulty, but I'm confused by the statement "flattening m is the same as flatMapping m&nbsp; with the identity function" and the reasoning leading up to it. How can flatMap be applied to the identity function? Doesn't this function lack the correct type signature for flatMap?</p>

<p>Great explanation, loving the entire series. Just wanted to add that if someone got confused (like me) over the second monad law</p>

<p>unit(x) flatMap f = f(x) </p>

<p>just remember that f is a monadic function returning M[A] which is why the law holds more at SO</p>

<p>After 7 years these 4 posts are still remarkably useful. If you still feel like maintaining them, I have two observations:</p>

<p>1) the definition of M3b should contain an "b &lt;- g(a)" and not "b &lt; g(a)"<br>2) as corollary of the second monad law, you showed that "unit map f = unit f", but not that "unit map g map f = unit f g". On step 5 in the last demonstration about the third law you use the second equality, which jumps a bit out of the blue...</p>

<p>In any case, fantastic job!! Eventually I am getting to monads. Now I am rushing to episode 4.</p>
